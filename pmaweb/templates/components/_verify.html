Since July 2015 all phpMyAdmin releases are cryptographically signed by the
releasing developer. You should verify that the signature matches the archive
you have downloaded. Verification instructions are placed in our
documentation in the <a href="https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/setup.html#verifying-phpmyadmin-releases">Verifying phpMyAdmin releases</a> chapter.
