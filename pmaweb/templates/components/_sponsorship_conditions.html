<h3 id="process">Sponsorship process</h3>

<ol>
<li>
Before starting the process make sure your sponsorship fits our <a href="#rules">conditions</a>. If unsure ask us at <a href="mailto:donate@phpmyadmin.net?subject=phpMyAdmin%20sponsorship%20question">&lt;donate@phpmyadmin.net&gt;</a>.
</li>
<li>
Please get in touch with us by
<a href="mailto:donate@phpmyadmin.net?subject=Invoice%20Requested%20for%20phpMyAdmin%20sponsorship">writing to &lt;donate@phpmyadmin.net&gt;</a>
and we will provide you payment information together with invoice.
</li>
<li>
The invoice can be paid by wire transfer, ACH, or
paper check, and instructions for payment will be provided with the
invoice. These methods of payment save the phpMyAdmin project a lot
in credit card processing fees, and puts more of your sponsorship to
work in supporting our project. For Bronze level you can pay conveniently 
using PayPal.
</li>
<li>
Received payment is processed by <a href="https://sfconservancy.org/">Software 
Freedom Conservancy</a>. This usually takes about one week, but might be 
delayed in times they are heavily loaded.
</li>
<li>
Your link and/or logo is placed to our website (depending on your <a href="#levels">sponsorship level</a>).
</li>
