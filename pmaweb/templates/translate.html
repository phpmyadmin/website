  <h2>Translating phpMyAdmin</h2>

  <p>
  For localization, phpMyAdmin uses Gettext; you can find po files for each
  translation in the <code>po</code> directory in phpMyAdmin sources. You can
  translate them using the usual tools for handling Gettext translations or use our
  <a href="https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/phpmyadmin/">translation server</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
  The phpMyAdmin's documentation is being translated using Sphinx and gettext (see
  <a href="{% url 'docs' %}">documentation</a> for existing
  translations) and the process here is pretty much the same as translating
  phpMyAdmin itself.
  </p>

  <p>
  It would be a good idea to subscribe to the <a
  href="https://lists.phpmyadmin.net/mailman/listinfo/translators">phpmyadmin-translators</a>
  mailing list, because this is where we ask for translations of new messages.
  </p>

  <h3>Using translation server</h3>

  <p>
  The <a href="https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/phpmyadmin/">translation server</a> 
  includes various subprojects, you should always focus on
  the latest stable branch. Once this one is complete you might want to continue
  translating <code>master</code> branch (which stands for the current development branch)
  or documentation. The changes are automatically propagated, so you don't have 
  to fear having to translate a message more than once.
  </p>

  <h3>Offline translating</h3>

  <p>
  As phpMyAdmin uses standard Gettext files, you can use your favorite editor to
  edit them. There are various editors for translations which you can use for
  offline translating.
  </p>

  <p>
  You can download po files either directly from Git (see 
  <a href="{% url 'develop' %}">developer instructions for more
  details</a>) or use the <a
  href="https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/phpmyadmin/">translation server</a>,
  which allows you to directly download the latest po file of the desired version.
  </p>

  <p>
  To submit your changes, you can either use the <a
  href="https://github.com/phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin/issues">issue 
  tracker at GitHub</a> or the <a
  href="https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/phpmyadmin/">translation server</a>,
  which can merge back your changed po file to the existing sources.
