  <h2>Download</h2>
  <p>
  Many operating systems already include a phpMyAdmin package and will
  automatically keep it updated, however these versions are sometimes
  slightly outdated and therefore may be missing the latest features.
  Additionally, the configuration process varies widely by package and
  may not adhere to the official phpMyAdmin documentation. That being said,
  it is usually the quickest and easiest way of keeping an updated installation. Please contact your OS
  vendor for more information. Some additional information is also available <a
  href="https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/setup.html">in our documentation</a>. If you just want to
  try phpMyAdmin in a virtual machine, you might want to check the <a
  href="#appliances">available software appliances which provide
  phpMyAdmin</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
  If you do not find a suitable package or wish to install your own phpMyAdmin,
  you can download one of the following
  kits. Please note that each version has requirements for the minimum PHP
  and MySQL versions.
  </p>

  </p>

  <h2>Older Releases</h2>
  <p>
  You can find older releases on <a href="{% url 'files' %}">separate files page</a>. You can also get them

  </p>

  <h2><a id="distributions"></a>Installing phpMyAdmin</h2>

  <p>
      The full process of installing phpMyAdmin is described in our <a
      href="https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/setup.html">manual</a>.  You
      can also find information there about how to install phpMyAdmin on your Linux
      distribution.
  </p>

  <h2><a id="docker"></a>Official Docker image</h2>
    <p>
        The phpMyAdmin team maintains an <a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/phpmyadmin">official Docker image for phpMyAdmin</a>.
        It is fully documented in <a href="https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/setup.html#docker">our manual</a>
        and you can install it using:
    </p>

    <pre>docker pull phpmyadmin</pre>

  <code class="select-all">docker pull phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin</code>

  <h2><a id="composer"></a>Installing using Composer</h2>

  <p>
      Due to technical limitations, we're currently unable to publish
      phpMyAdmin directly in Packagist repository, but it is possible to
      install phpMyAdmin from our own Composer repository. Please check
      <a href="https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/setup.html#composer">our manual</a>
      for more information.
  </p>

  <h2><a id="appliances"></a>Appliances</h2>
  <p>
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_appliance">Software appliances</a>
      are becoming a popular way of distributing software. They are
      distributed as an image, which can be directly used by system (be it
      ISO image for bootable CD or virtual disks for some type of
      virtualization).
  </p>
  <p>
      There are quite many appliances which provide phpMyAdmin as a
      management tool for MySQL. It usually comes as part of LAMP stack
      but there might be other offerings as well. Please check your
      favorite appliance provider, ISV or app store for it. Some of the
      appliances are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_AMP_packages">
      listed on Wikipedia</a>.
  </p>

  <h2 id="support">Supported versions</h2>

  <p>
  Generally only last stable branch is supported, but there are LTS branches
  to support older PHP versions. Current stable branch is supported for bug
  fixes, LTS branches for security fixes only.
