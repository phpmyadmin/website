<h2>Download</h2>
<p>
  Many operating systems already include a phpMyAdmin package and will automatically keep it updated. However, these versions are sometimes slightly outdated and may be missing the latest features. Additionally, the configuration process varies widely by package and may not adhere to the official phpMyAdmin documentation. That being said, it is usually the quickest and easiest way of keeping an updated installation. Please contact your OS vendor for more information. Some additional information is also available 
  <a href="https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/setup.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in our documentation</a>. If you just want to try phpMyAdmin in a virtual machine, you might want to check the 
  <a href="#appliances">available software appliances which provide phpMyAdmin</a>.
</p>
<p>
  If you do not find a suitable package or wish to install your own phpMyAdmin, you can download one of the following kits. Please note that each version has requirements for the minimum PHP and MySQL versions.
</p>

{% for release in releases %}
  <h3>phpMyAdmin {{ release.version }}</h3>
  {% include "_release.html" %}
{% endfor %}

{% if beta_release %}
  {% with beta_release as release %}
    <h3>Testing: phpMyAdmin {{ release.version }}</h3>
    {% include "_release.html" %}
  {% endwith %}
{% endif %}

<h3>Development Versions</h3>
{% include "_gitdl.html" %}

<p>
  More information about using Git is available on the 
  <a href="{% url 'develop' %}">development page</a>.
</p>

{% for release in all_snapshots %}
  <h3>phpMyAdmin {{ release.version }}</h3>

</p>

<h2 id="distributions">Installing phpMyAdmin</h2>

<p>
  The full process of installing phpMyAdmin is described in our

</p>

<h2>Official Docker image</h2>

<p>
  The phpMyAdmin team maintains an 
  <a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/phpmyadmin" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">official Docker image for phpMyAdmin</a>. It is fully documented in 
  <a href="https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/setup.html#docker" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our manual</a> and you can install it using:
</p>

<pre>docker pull phpmyadmin</pre>

<h2 id="appliances">Appliances</h2>
<p>
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_appliance" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Software appliances</a> are becoming a popular way of distributing software. They are distributed as an image, which can be directly used by the system (be it an ISO image for a bootable CD or virtual disks for some type of virtualization).
</p>
<p>
  There are quite a few appliances that provide phpMyAdmin as a management tool for MySQL. It usually comes as part of a LAMP stack, but there might be other offerings as well. Please check your favorite appliance provider, ISV, or app store for it. Some of the appliances are 
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_AMP_packages" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">listed on Wikipedia</a>.
</p>

<h2 id="support">Supported versions</h2>

<p>
  Generally, only the last stable branch is supported, but there are LTS branches to support older PHP versions. The current stable branch is supported for bug fixes, and LTS branches for security fixes only.
