  <h2>Getting help with phpMyAdmin</h2>

  <p>
  phpMyAdmin strives to be as helpful as possible during the install, but
  sometimes it happens: it just won't work. Here's a list of resources and
  information you can use when you're trying to get it working:
  </p>

  <h3>Recent versions of all programs</h3>

  <p>
  It's true, software has bugs. Those bugs get fixed, but if you're still running
  a broken version of PHP that doesn't handle arrays correctly, you'll never get
  phpMyAdmin (or any other PHP script) working properly. If at all possible try
  to run the most recent versions of MySQL, PHP, and phpMyAdmin.
  </p>

  <h3>Use the phpMyAdmin source</h3>

  <p>
  Many distributions ship with binary installs for phpMyAdmin (Gentoo's
  portage/emerge, Debian's dpkg/apt, etc). If you have a problem with one of
  those, seek help from the package maintainer. If you want to ask us, first get
  the source from <a href="{% url 'downloads' %}">our downloads page</a> and run through the 
  <a href="https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/setup.html#quick-install">quick install guide</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>Read the documentation!</h3>

  <p>
  Yes, <a href="https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/">the documentation</a> is large, but
  that's because it has a lot of information in it. Search for your error message
  or problem. Read the <a href="https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/faq.html">frequently asked questions</a> â€” many
  common problems are answered there.
