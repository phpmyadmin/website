<h2>Donations</h2>

{% include "components\_conservancy.html" %}

<p>
As a free software project, phpMyAdmin has almost no revenues itself. On the
other side, we have some expenses. Currently most of the project's funds are 
used to hire contractors for development and bug fixes, and for travel costs to allow team members to meet at conferences.
</p>

<p>
For the general public, the suggested donation amount is 10 USD.
</p>
