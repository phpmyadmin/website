<h2>Contribute to phpMyAdmin</h2>

<p>
  As a free software project, phpMyAdmin is very open to your contributions. You don't
  need developer skills to help; there are several non-coding ways to get involved
  in the project (code is welcome too, of course!).
</p>

<p>
  You may also decide to apply for a <a href="{% url 'contractor' %}">contract developer position</a> with the project.
</p>

<h3>An Invitation to Students</h3>

<p>
  To gain practical experience in open-source development, you are welcome to contribute to phpMyAdmin. Usually, this is volunteer work, but since 2008, our project has been part of <a href="https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Summer of Code</a>. This program "offers post-secondary student developers ages 18 and older stipends to write code for various open source software projects". So, <a href="https://github.com/phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin/wiki/GSoC_home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">join us</a> soon and get ready for the next GSoC!
</p>

<h3>Helping Users</h3>

<p>
  Interested in helping other users with phpMyAdmin? Visit our <a href="{% url 'support' %}">support</a> page and share your experience.
</p>

<h3 id="translate">Localization</h3>

<p>
  phpMyAdmin is being translated into many languages, but maybe your language is not
  really up to date? You can easily contribute on our
  <a href="https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/phpmyadmin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">translation server</a>.
  You can find out more on the <a href="{% url 'translate' %}">translation page</a>.
</p>

<h3>Testing and Quality Assurance</h3>

<p>
  One important thing for us is to avoid problems in the user interface. You can really help
  us here by providing feedback on releases and especially by testing the pre-releases
  (alpha/beta/rc) we provide for testing. Just download them and <a href="https://github.com/phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin/issues" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report any issues</a>
  you face with them.
</p>

<h3>Documentation Writer/Tutorial Creator</h3>

<p>
  Do you feel our documentation misses some points? We welcome additions; just
  let us know how you think the documentation can be improved.
  The best way is to submit a <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pull request</a>
  to our <a href="https://github.com/phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub repository</a>.
  If you don't know how to make these changes, we still want to hear your input.
  You can submit a <a href="https://github.com/phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin/labels/enhancement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">feature request</a>
  explaining your suggested improvements.
</p>

<p>
  Also, documentation does not have to be text only. We would welcome some
  video tutorials giving users hints on how to do specific tasks inside phpMyAdmin.
</p>

<h3>Developing</h3>

<p>
  Coding contributions are very welcome. The easiest way is to fork our code on GitHub
  and submit a pull request. We really welcome bug fixes or new features.
  You can find out more on the <a href="{% url 'develop' %}">developers page</a>.
</p>

<h3>Bug and Feature Management</h3>

<p>
  Our trackers, especially the
  <a href="https://github.com/phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin/labels/enhancement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">feature tracker</a>,
  contain dozens of entries which might already be implemented or don't make much sense after years.
  You can go through reported issues, verify if they still apply to the latest version and
  check whether they would still be useful. Also, checking incoming reports for all required
  information or whether they were already reported is welcome help.
</p>

<h3>Fund Our Project</h3>

<p>
  We need money to allow our presence at conferences, buy new hardware, or provide various
  useful services to our users and developers. By <a href="{% url 'donate' %}">donating</a>
  you help us in this area and possibly increase our presence at conferences.
</p>

<p>
  We also use donated funds to hire <a href="{% url 'contractor' %}">contract developers</a> who
  are paid directly to work on bug fixing, new features, and other phpMyAdmin improvements.
</p>
