<h2>Developing phpMyAdmin</h2>

<p>
phpMyAdmin is (as the name says) written in PHP and uses MySQL. Besides this,
we also need people skilled in HTML, JavaScript and CSS, as these are parts
which make our user interface. You don't have to be expert in all these areas
- even knowing only one of them, you can still provide substantial help in
creating or debugging some features.
</p>

<h3>Source Code Repository</h3>
<xi:include href="_gitdl.tpl" />

<p>
To checkout the code you can use one of following examples:
</p>

<pre>
#  Using git protocol:
git clone git://github.com/phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin.git

# In case your firewall blocks git, you can use https:
git clone https://github.com/phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin.git
</pre>

<h3>Contributing code</h3>
<p>
The easiest way to contribute is to <a href="https://github.com/phpmyadmin">fork our code on github</a>
and initiate a <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests">pull request</a>
once you are done with some feature/bugfix. Please keep your changes as small as possible; do not include unrelated changes like formatting, whitespace and new line characters.
</p>
<p>
Our developers will then merge your code or will guide you through 
improving the patch. The patch will be of course committed under your 
name and mail, so that you receive appropriate credits. Generally after 
merging several good patches you will be offered write access to our 
repository.
</p>
