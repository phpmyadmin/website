    <h2>Download</h2>
    <p>
    Many operating systems already include a phpMyAdmin package and will
    automatically keep it updated, however these versions are sometimes
    slightly outdated and therefore may be missing the latest features.
    Additionally, the configuration process varies widely by package and
    may not adhere to the official phpMyAdmin documentation. That being said,
    it is usually the quickest way to an updated installation. Please contact your OS
    vendor for more information. Some additional information is also available <a
    href="http://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/setup.html">in our documentation</a>. If you just want to
    try phpMyAdmin in virtual machine, you might want to check the <a
    href="#appliances">available software appliances which provide
    phpMyAdmin</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
    If you do not have a package available or desire to install your own phpMyAdmin,
    you can download one of following
    source packages. Please note that phpMyAdmin requires at least PHP 5.2
    and MySQL 5.

    <h2><a id="appliances"></a>Appliances</h2>
    <p>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_appliance">Software appliances</a>
        are becoming a popular way of distributing software. They are
        distributed as an image, which can be directly used by system (be it
        ISO image for bootable CD or virtual disks for some type of
        virtualization).
    </p>
    <p>
        There are quite many appliances which provide phpMyAdmin as a
        management tool for MySQL. It usually comes as part of LAMP stack
        but there might be other offerings as well. Please check your 
        favorite appliance provider, ISV or app store for it. Some of the
        appliances are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_AMP_packages">
        listed on Wikipedia</a>.
