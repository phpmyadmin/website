    <h2>Download</h2>
    <p>
    Many operating systems already include a phpMyAdmin package and will
    automatically keep it updated, however these versions are sometimes
    slightly outdated and therefore may be missing the latest features.
    Additionally, the configuration process varies widely by package and
    may not adhere to the official phpMyAdmin documentation. That being said,
    it is usually the quickest way to an updated installation. Please contact your OS
    vendor for more information. Some additional information is also available <a
    href="#distributions">further down on this page</a>. If you just want to
    try phpMyAdmin in virtual machine, you might want to check the <a
    href="#appliances">available software appliances which provide
    phpMyAdmin</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
    If you do not have a package available or desire to install your own phpMyAdmin,
    you can download one of following
    source packages. Please note that phpMyAdmin requires at least PHP 5.2
    and MySQL 5.

    <h2><a id="distributions"></a>Installing phpMyAdmin in Linux distributions</h2>
    <h3>Debian</h3>
    <p>
        Debian's package repositories include a phpMyAdmin package, but be
        aware that the configuration file is maintained in
        <code>/etc/phpmyadmin</code> and may differ in some ways from the
        official phpMyAdmin documentation. The package maintainer often visits
        the official IRC channel (#phpmyadmin on irc.freenode.net).
    </p>
    <h3>OpenSUSE</h3>
    <p>
        OpenSUSE already comes with phpMyAdmin package, just install packages from

        Service</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Gentoo ships the phpMyAdmin package, both in a near stock configuration

    <h3>Fedora</h3>
    <p>
        Fedora ships the phpMyAdmin package, but be aware that the

        may differ in some ways from the official phpMyAdmin documentation.

    <h3>Red Hat Enterprise Linux</h3>
    <p>
        Red Hat Enterprise Linux itself and thus derivates like CentOS don't
        ship phpMyAdmin, but the Fedora-driven repository <a
        href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL">Extra Packages for Enterprise
        Linux</a> (EPEL) is doing so, if it's <a
        href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL/FAQ#howtouse">enabled</a>.
        But be aware that the configuration file is maintained in
        <code>/etc/phpMyAdmin/</code> and may differ in some ways from the
        official phpMyAdmin documentation.

        ISO image for bootable CD or virtual disks for some type of
        virtualization).
