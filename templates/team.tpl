<h2>Team meetings</h2>

<p>
We would like to meet other members of the team more often; so far only a few
team meetings in real life have happened.
</p>
<p>The first one was at a big party in Karlsruhe, Germany for the 10th anniversary
of PHP and MySQL at the <a href="http://www.linuxtag.org/2005">LinuxTag</a> 2005
LAMP Area, with some special guests.
</p>
<p>The second meeting took place in Brussels, Belgium during 
<a href="http://fosdem.org/2010">FOSDEM 2010</a>. Marc Delisle talked
about &quot;State of phpMyAdmin&quot; in the MySQL developer room.
</p>
<p>The third meeting took place in Brussels, Belgium during 
<a href="http://fosdem.org/2012">FOSDEM 2012</a>. The team talked about
future directions for the project.
</p>
<p>The fourth meeting took place in Vaumarcus, Switzerland during
<a href="http://debconf13.debconf.org/">Debconf13</a>. The team did
a <a href="http://www.irill.org/videos/debconf13/phpMyAdmin_tutorial.webm">tutorial</a>
showing basic and more advanced features of phpMyAdmin.
</p>
<p>During <a href="http://linuxtag.org/2014/en">LinuxTag 2014</a> in Berlin, Germany, our project was an exhibitor and we held our fifth team meeting.
